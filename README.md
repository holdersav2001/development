## Pushing Code to GitHub

To push your code to a GitHub repository under the account "holdersav2001", follow these steps:

1. Initialize a Git repository in your project folder (if not already done):
   ```
   git init
   ```

2. Add all files to the Git repository:
   ```
   git add .
   ```

3. Commit the changes:
   ```
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

4. Create a new repository on GitHub:
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Enter a repository name
   - Choose whether it should be public or private
   - Do not initialize the repository with a README, .gitignore, or license

5. Connect your local repository to the GitHub repository:
   ```
   git remote add origin https://github.com/holdersav2001/your-repo-name.git
   ```
   Replace "your-repo-name" with the name you chose for your GitHub repository.

6. Push your code to GitHub:
   ```
   git push -u origin main
   ```
   If your default branch is named "master" instead of "main", use:
   ```
   git push -u origin master
   ```

7. If prompted, enter your GitHub username and password. If you have two-factor authentication enabled, you'll need to use a personal access token instead of your password.

After following these steps, your code should be pushed to your GitHub repository under the account "holdersav2001".

Remember to regularly commit and push your changes to keep your GitHub repository up to date:

```
git add .
git commit -m "Description of your changes"
git push
```
